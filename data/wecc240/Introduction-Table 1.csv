"This data set documents a 240-bus model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, as used in paper 2011GM0942, ""Reduced Network Modeling of WECC as a Market Design",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prototype"", presented at the 2011 IEEE PES General Meeting (referred to in the descriptions below as the IEEE PES paper).  This spreadsheet contains a variety of data that",,,,,,,,,,,,
"supplement a power flow model in PTI PSS/E version 23 format (WECC240_M21_psse23_v01b.raw), and is distributed in a compressed (zip) file with the paper and power flow case.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This model has been developed to support Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC) project M-21, ""Technical and Economic Implications of Greenhouse Gas Regulation",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in a Transmission Constrained Restructured Electricity Market"".  A previous 225-bus version was used in PSERC project M-13, ""Agent Modeling for Integrated Power Systems"",",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and this model version 1 is being further developed through PSERC project M-24, ""Interactions of Multiple Market-based Energy and Environmental Policies in a Transmission-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Constrained Competitive National Electricity Market"", and related projects.  The specific data contained in this spreadsheet is what was used for paper 2011GM0942, and is",,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generators,"The generators in this model are aggregations by geographic area and type of resource, and ownership among major market participants for",,,,,,,,,,,
,"generators within the CAISO, representing approximately a 2005 to 2010 timeframe based on available data at the time of constructing this data set.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"These aggregations are named for the buses where they are modeled, and codes following the bus numbers identify the type of resource and ownership:",,,,,,,,,,,
,Type of resource:,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"B = biomass, C = coal, E = geothermal, G = gas, H = hydro, N = nuclear,",,,,,,,,,,
,,"R = generic renewable (small aggregations that are not dominated by a single type), S = solar, W = wind",,,,,,,,,,
,"This data set includes characteristics for future expansions of renewable resources, for approximately a 2015 to 2020 timeframe.  These data are",,,,,,,,,,,
,"designated by appending ""new"" at the end of the generation aggregation name.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Data for pumped storage generation are on the ""Storage & DR"" page rather than the ""Generators"" page due to having different data structures.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Resource ownership within the CAISO is designated for companies whose total generation may be sufficient to have market power in some areas,,,,,,,,,,,
,"(designated using the CAISO's codes for scheduling coordinators) and for generation owners that are vertically integrated utilities (i.e., load serving",,,,,,,,,,,
,"entities) in Northern and Southern California (combinations of investor-owned and municipal utilities, including small generators that may be",,,,,,,,,,,
,under contract to the utilities):,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"A = an aggregation of multiple owners of large generators that do not have market power at a system level, C = CPCO, D = DETM, E = ECI,",,,,,,,,,,
,,"M = SCEM, N = Northern California vertical utilities, R = RESI, S = Southern California vertical utilities, W = WESC",,,,,,,,,,
,"(Generation owners that are also load serving entities are distinguished for use of this data set for market behavior studies, such as agent modeling,",,,,,,,,,,,
,because such companies' bidding strategies may be to minimize prices for their customers rather than to maximize profits from generation.),,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"After identifying the generation aggregations, this spreadsheet page contains basic resource characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Heat rate data for gas-fired generation is in the ""Generator Heat Rates"" page.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hourly profiles for most renewable resources are included on the ""Load & Gen Profiles"" and ""Typical Week Profiles"" pages.  The resource output is",,,,,,,,,,,
,"limited to these profiles, which are not used for dispatchable generators whose output is determined by economics.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hydro ratings, minimum loading (""Min Stable Level""), and ramp rates are assumed values as discussed in the IEEE PES paper.  In assumptions for",,,,,,,,,,,
,"hydro capacity factors, Q2 and Q4 are calendar quarters (Spring and Fall), and M05 and M11 are calendar months (May and November).",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In this paper's modeling, renewable resources (biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and generic renewables) and base-load coal and nuclear generators",,,,,,,,,,,
,"are given the highest dispatch priority, with a heat rate of 1.  Hydro has higher priority than gas-fired generation, at a heat rate of 5.  For simplicity,",,,,,,,,,,,
,this paper used a fuel price of $5/GJ for all resources.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Because optimization of DC lines' schedules is not common in market simulation modeling, the Pacific DC line is  modeled as a 2773.8 MW generator",,,,,,,,,,,
,at SYLMARLA 230 {2619} and a 3133.6 MW load at CELILO 230 {4010}.  The Intermountain DC line is modeled as a 1863.9 MW generator at,,,,,,,,,,,
,ADELANTO 500 {2600} and a 2050.8 MW load at INTERMT 345 {2604}.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generator Heat Rates,"Generator heat rate data is stated as incremental heat rates consisting of a series of MW output points, ""Heat Point (MW)"", and incremental heat rates",,,,,,,,,,,
,"between these points (""Heat Rate Incr"", expressed in the software in GJ/MWh).  A limitation in the source data that have been aggregated in these",,,,,,,,,,,
,generation aggregations must be recognized:  the source data contained a single heat rate for each of the individual generators that have been,,,,,,,,,,,
,"aggregated, which could be interpreted as both its average and its incremental heat rate.  For the generation aggregations, the individual generators",,,,,,,,,,,
,"have been sorted by heat rate, and the MW values are the summation of capacity through the level at which the heat rate appears.  This limitation",,,,,,,,,,,
,will be addressed in a subsequent version of this data set.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gen Commitment Scenario,The IEEE PES paper discusses an analysis of modeling the impact of unit commitment by partially disaggregating the generation aggregations for,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Southern California.  In the data used for this scenario, certain individual generators are modeled separately using the data contained on this",,,,,,,,,,,
,"spreadsheet page.  This page also includes data for the remaining generation aggregations, with the individually-modeled generators removed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In the basecase scenarios of the IEEE PES paper, all generators are committed on.  This contrasts with the unit commitment scenario in which the",,,,,,,,,,,
,"listed generators, which are only available in the unit commitment scenario, are subject to unit commitment.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"In the unit commitment scenario, the aggregated generators MESA CAL 20 {2438 EG}, MESA CAL 20 {2438 RG}, and MESA CAL 20 {2438 WG} are also",,,,,,,,,,,
,"subject to unit commitment, although ramp rate, min up time, and start cost remain unspecified as in the base case.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generator Data Details CAISO,"In the event that a research study needs additional detail about the constituents of this model's generation aggregations, this spreadsheet page",,,,,,,,,,,
,"provides data from ""Assumptions for long term modeling of the California energy market for Path 26 transmission upgrade assessment"",",,,,,,,,,,,
,"prepared by London Economics International LLC for the California ISO and RFP Steering Committee, issued May 2002 (updated July 2002).",,,,,,,,,,,
,Future versions of this model will update these data and correct inconsistencies in translation to this model.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generator Data Details Non-CISO,"Whereas data on CAISO generation are available from the London Economics study cited above, that data set does not include resources outside",,,,,,,,,,,
,"the CAISO.  For external resource data, this model has used data made available by the WECC Transmission Expansion Planning Policy Committee",,,,,,,,,,,
,(TEPPC) through the WECC web site.  Future versions of this model will update these data.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Load & Gen Profiles,"This spreadsheet page contains hourly load data for 11 areas within the CAISO, which were prepared for the market simulations reported",,,,,,,,,,,
,"in reference [11] in the IEEE PES paper, hourly load data for the same period for other areas of WECC (and California Dept. of Water Resources",,,,,,,,,,,
,"pumping data within the CAISO) compiled from the TEPPC data cited above, and generation profiles for renewable resources compiled from the",,,,,,,,,,,
,TEPPC data for the generation aggregations used in this model.  This spreadsheet page also contains hydroelectric output data resulting from the,,,,,,,,,,,
,"simulations described in the IEEE PES paper, resulting from the PLEXOS software's optimization within the input assumptions described in the paper.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"As described above for the ""Generators"" spreadsheet page, profiles for generation agregations identified as ""new"" are only available in future years.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical Week Profiles,"To facilitate fast execution times in modeling that does not require the full 8760-hour chronoloy of the ""Load & Gen Profiles"" page, this page contains",,,,,,,,,,,
,"""typical week"" profiles in which each week represents conditions for one calendar quarter, so that the year consists of four weeks (28 days).",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The ""typical week"" data consist of calculated load profiles with one week representing each season (Q1 = days 1 to 7, Q2 = days 8 - 14, etc.), which",,,,,,,,,,,
,"preserve the peaks, minimum loads, and average loads of each season, and representative changes in load between hours.  Intermittent resource",,,,,,,,,,,
,data are included for a selected day out of the full-year profiles.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Like the ""Load & Gen Profiles"" data described above, hydro profiles are the outputs of base case simulations, for comparison with alternative",,,,,,,,,,,
,"scenarios, and for use with software that does not have hydro optimization features.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Storage & DR,"The IEEE PES paper describes use of this model in comparing the benefits of different types of storage and demand response resources, using input",,,,,,,,,,,
,assumptions contained on this spreadsheet page.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Ramp rates are not known from publicly available data.  Assumed values are same for upward and downward ramping.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Pump efficiency assumptions exceed likely physical values, but are needed due to large flat heat rate segments in the thermal generator data.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Available storage volume of pumped storage generation is estimated from public descriptions of the projects.  Head and tail storage volumes are assumed to be equal.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"To model needs to place energy into storage before it can be used for generation, initial state places all energy in the tail storage.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"""SCE Responsive Storage"" is used only in ""Responsive DR Storage"" scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"""SCE Responsive Storage"" is active during on-peak hours, and subject to economic unit commitment in other hours.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"""SCE Responsive Storage"", ""SCE Responsive Charging"", and ""SCE Vehicles"" are distributed 76.6% at node MESA CAL 20 {2438} and 23.4% at SERRANO 500 {2501}.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"""SCE Responsive Charging"" is implemented as a 1000 MW ""SCE Vehicles"" load during off-peak hours, and a 1000 MW generator with minimum 49% and",,,,,,,,,,,
,"maximum 50% daily capacity factor, both active only in off-peak hours.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"""SCE Responsive Charging"" contrasts with the ""SCE Fixed Charging"" scenario in which ""SCE Vehicles"" has a 500 MW fixed load during off-peak hours, at a",,,,,,,,,,,
,$100/MWh bid price.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"On-peak is hours 12 - 17. off-peak is hours 1 - 6 and 23 - 24, and mid-peak in between these periods.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"CISO DWR's load is distributed 51.2% at node MESA CAL 20 {2438}, 26% at MIDWAY 20 {3845}, and 22.8% at TESLA 20 {3933}",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Load Participation Factors,"The ""Load & Gen Profiles"" and ""Typical Week Profiles"" pages contain hourly loads for areas within the CAISO and WECC that consist of multiple buses,",,,,,,,,,,,
,in which loads are distributed throughout each area.  Equivalencing from a full WECC model to the 240-bus size of this model translates the load,,,,,,,,,,,
,"distribution to this reduced set of nodal loads, and the load participation factors state the percentage of area load that is located at each bus within",,,,,,,,,,,
,"the region.  In model simulations, nodal loads are obtained by distributing the area loads in proportion to the load distribution factors.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Branches,This spreadsheet page contains modeling data for the lines and transformers between the 240 buses in this model.  These values have originated from,,,,,,,,,,,
,a previous 179-bus network model developed for reference [5] of the IEEE PES paper.  The 240-bus model presented here has preserved the,,,,,,,,,,,
,"characteristics of the lines that were in the 179-bus model, without validating them against values derived from a full WECC model.  The topology",,,,,,,,,,,
,of the network has been conformed to published (high-level) diagrams in grid planning studies by the CAISO and other organizations responsible for,,,,,,,,,,,
,"transmission planning.  In cases where lines and transformers needed to be added to the model to conform to published network diagrams, the",,,,,,,,,,,
,"reactance and resistance of the lines and transformers have been replicated from the 179-bus model, but not the line capacity.  Limits of 99999 MW",,,,,,,,,,,
,mean that no rating is available from the 179-bus model.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The model user needs to be aware that the maximum flow limits shown in this table are from the 179-bus model developed through a separate project,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"for a different purpose, and often do not apply to the 240-bus WECC model.  Users are advised to use the interface limits on the ""Interface"" page as",,,,,,,,,,,
,"more realistic values for market studies, or to modify the branch limits as needed to create other study scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This spreadsheet also contains a column titled ""Hurdle Rate (Wheeling Charge) ($/MWh)"".  Use of this model has shown that simply performing an",,,,,,,,,,,
,optimal power flow market optimization across the entire WECC region easily produces transactions between areas that are unrealistic due to,,,,,,,,,,,
,"differences in market structure between areas within WECC (e.g., the organized market in the CAISO vs. the bilateral markets in other parts of",,,,,,,,,,,
,"WECC).  Part of the impact of these ""hurdles"" to free-flowing transactions between areas can be replicated by applying ""hurdle rates"", or ""wheeling",,,,,,,,,,,
,"charges"", for flows across the boundaries of areas within WECC.  This column identifies the lines to which this has applied in the IEEE PES paper.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The best modeling results can be obtained by tuning the values of the hurdle rates, although this can be a very time-intensive task to replicate known",,,,,,,,,,,
,variations in path flows that ca be found in grid planning studies.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interfaces,"Actual operations in WECC are often managed through limits on transmission interfaces (also known as corridors, flowgates, paths, etc.) that are",,,,,,,,,,,
,"determined in advance of actual operating hours through studies that are more complex than can be analyzed in real-time, including contingency",,,,,,,,,,,
,"analysis considering llarge numbers of potential outages, voltage stability, transient stability, etc.  Several of the interface limits that affect WECC",,,,,,,,,,,
,"are included in this model, where these limits have been publicly documented.  Within the CAISO, a stakeholder process previous to the",,,,,,,,,,,
,"implementation of the CAISO's current market design identified and discussed several areas of known congestion, and those interface limits are",,,,,,,,,,,
,also modeled here.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For each interface, this table identifies the branches that define the interface and state the value used in the IEEE PES paper to resemble actual",,,,,,,,,,,
,"occurrences of congestion as a model of market response.  As such, some flow limits needed to be adjusted from their actual values.  In the",,,,,,,,,,,
,"interface definitions, the column of values in ""Direction (flow coefficient)"" is a multiplier to account for the constrained direction of the interface",,,,,,,,,,,
,"relative to the ""to"" and ""from"" ends of the lines as listed in the ""Branches"" spreadsheet page.  Minimum flow limits are stated only if there may be",,,,,,,,,,,
,a binding limit in the reverse direction.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Note that the SCIT limit varies with system conditions.  For chronological data, this data set uses 10,800 MW for M06 and Q3.  For typical week data,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"this data set uses 10,000 MW.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Because these flow limits have been set to study market impacts of certain scenarios.  The values may not reflect actual path limits, and should be",,,,,,,,,,,
,set to create the market conditions needed for other specific study scenarios.,,,,,,,,,,,
